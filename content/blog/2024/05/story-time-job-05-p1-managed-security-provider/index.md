## Introduction

As I said in [the last part](/blog/2024/05/story-time-job-04-p2-promoted-then-poached/), this was a step up. A real step up. It was a tiny company, only 10 people, so a lot of responsibilities and nowhere to hide.

> I did really want to get into Security, Networking, Unix/Linux, and this seemed like a great opportunity.

The downsides though were that **MSP** (as I will call them), were, as a company, not doing great. The company was founded in the late 90s by *The Founder*, who had eventually sold the company, and then the people he sold the company to.. sold the company to someone else.. who sold it to someone else...

It has started off offering Networking and Security to SMEs getting their first connection to the Big Scary Internet, and they paid a lot for the expertise and support of the Big Scary Firewalls from **MSP**.

Those days were already almost gone by the time I joined, companies were realising they didn't need to pay 5-figures a year for a *Firewall*, and could get something for an order of magnitude cheaper and simpler, and didn't really *need* a support contract to run the things.

The cherry on top was that the current three co-owners had tried a failed pivot into... Windows hosting. It didn't make much sense.

## My First Month They Dissolved The Company

So I got *one* single monthly pay cheque with the company.. then we had a company meeting where one of the owners told us the *good news* that they had dissolved that company... but don't worry! *Nothing's Changing Except The Name.*

It was apparently a way kick out one of the co-owners, without the other co-owners buying them out.

*This Was Not A Good Sign*.

## How To Piss Off A New Starter

In our [last part](/blog/2024/05/story-time-job-04-p2-promoted-then-poached/) I noted this detail:

> The salary offer wasn't amazing, I managed to get them to match my current salary, but with a clause to increase my salary by £500 (ie, a *small* payrise) if I got a *Check Point* certification within 6 months of my start date (which they would pay for).

I asked about when I would get *Check Point* training a few times, and each time I was brushed off.

Eventually, when I pressed the point, it seemed like they just didn't want to pay for the training at all, and told me that they'd only pay for me to sit the exam, but I would have to do the training from a book, rather than an (expensive) class-based training program.

So... I did. I spent a couple of months working through the book, reading what I could online, and using our very limited "lab" equipment (some EOL servers and trial licences).. before taking and passing the exam to become a **Check Point Certified Security Administrator** in November 2008.

I was happy that I finally got the certification, but I was told the MD didn't want to give me the £500 payrise as my contract said, as he said I had to get it within 6 months of starting, and this was *8 months* since I joined..

I was fuming, as they had kept me hanging on waiting for the training, and I was seriously prepared to walk out over this... they relented but I got a patronizing finger-wagging:

*"Okay, you can have it, but we're letting you off, keep your end of the bargain next time though.."* :angry:

## I Hope You Like Solaris..

The role I had was as a *Network Security Engineer* working with two other Engineers, the Senior Engineer who had been there the longest, but seemed to have lost all interest in the job, and a Junior Engineer (on a University Placement year), who was very junior but bright and engaged.

The job was a combination of:
* Support In-Office - Answering the phones, updating tickets, dealing with customers firewall requests/incidents.
* Support Out of Hours - On-call monitoring customer's firewalls, and our critical internal infrastructure.
* Internal IT - Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, Email, Servers, Networks etc

The In-Office Support side was fairly quiet, as we didn't actually *have* many customers!

So most of my Monday-Friday 9-5 time was working on our internal infrastructure. There was next to no documentation on it, and everyone who did know about it had already left.

It appeared to have been frozen in time. Almost all the Unix servers were running ancient versions of *Solaris* (versions 8 or 9 - 2000 or 2002 vintage - and this was 2008) on anemic SPARC hardware. I don't think anybody dared touch it, as nobody understood how it worked.

An illustrative story was that one of my first tasks was to *Change The Backup Tapes* each week. I did this for a couple of weeks and asked *"So.. what do we actually backup to these tapes?"*... the answer was *"I don't know, I just know we back **something** up to them.."*

## The Quest For A Competent Sales Person

I was at the company for about a year and a half in total, and I saw 5 Sales people come and go.

1. The Sales Guy Who Didn't Have A Single Sale (after a year working there)

He was caught one afternoon in the pub around the corner from the office after saying he was heading out "to a client site" :beer:. We were told the story after witnessing a stand-up argument in our open plan office, after which he stormed out and never came back.

2. The Sales Guy Who Didn't Come Back After His First Day

He was a smart one, he must've done the maths on his lack of prospective commission after seeing the tumbleweeds in the *Customer Relationship Management* database.

3. The Sales Guy Who Didn't Have Transport

He had an old Vauxhall Vectra that broke down in his first month and he never fixed it. Was memorable for sending a mass-email with the subject line **"Does tha want a freebie?"** to all our prospects/clients when messing around our *Customer Relationship Management* tool.

He seemed happy to sit in the office and live off his (minimal) salary (with zero commission).

4. The Sales Guy Who Was Actually Good

This guy was great, he worked with Jay to come up with viable products and services we could offer, he actually started making sales, increasing each month. :moneybag: :sparkles:

He was fired in the latter days of the company's downward trajectory, with the **Managing Director** giving us the reasoning that:

> "We could only afford either a Managing Director *or* a Sales Person, not both.. so I figured he'd have to go, as I can do both roles."

5. The Sales Guy Who Was Actually The Managing Director

He was not a good Sales Person, and we all knew the company was doomed (foreshadowing!)
