## Be Careful What You Wish For..

So, in our [last part](/blog/2024/04/story-time-job-04-p1-going-back-3rd-line-support/) I wrote about how I got promoted up to the halycon heights of the Infrastructure Team.

I wrote about the *Cons* of the promotion:

> Cons:
> * David would be my manager (..and he had a very poor reputation)
> * Their On-Call was awful (and Christmas/New Years was coming up)

My plan to skip their :christmas_tree: Christmas On-Call worked. I kept my mouth shut about on-call, and when the topic came up, everyone in the team groaned when I told them I couldn't do any cover as I'd already booked the time off.

David, the boss, responded with a wagged finger and a smile and said:

> "Well, next Christmas you'll be the last one to pick.." (aka the worst days)

..but after only a few months of working for David I knew there was *no way* I could cope until next Christmas :smile:

## Worst Manager (So Far)

David's management style was difficult for most people to live with. It was pretty micro-managey, and he would not really take "no" for an answer on a lot of things.

Some examples:-

* The office was refurbished and David managed to increase his corner-office to such a huge degree that there wasn't really much room for the 7 other people on his team.
* At one point half of his team had quit or been fired, and David was forced by HR to attend a week-long offsite *Management Training Program*.. This was a cause of much amusement in the office. When David returned someone asked him how it went? His response was *"It was a waste of time really, there wasn't much they could teach me about management."* (cue lots of eye rolling.. :roll_eyes:)
* David didn't care to understand the difference between "on-call" and "planned out of hours work". Over the Christmas holidays, when the business was closed completely, he would try to make the unlucky on-call engineer do a *"Tea and Biscuits Run"* (his way of asking them to log-on, and check all the systems manually... thus defeating the point of the monitoring/alerting system..)

## Losing Database Administrator #1

This DBA managed to squeeze a training couse out of David, and the training was over a few days on-site in London.

To say it didn't go well is an understatement:

1. He took one of the IT Department's Pool Cars down to London, had to call out a breakdown service after filling it up with Petrol instead of Diesel.
2. His work laptop got stolen on the London Underground (...and it turned out he'd been running a personal firewall on his domain-joined laptop, which blocked company backups, and lost years worth of work).

When he returned and told us the two mistakes above, someone made the comment that *"bad luck comes in threes"*.

3. A couple of weeks after the training, HR forwarded an Bus Lane Penalty Charge Notice from a camera in London for the pool car he'd been driving down there.

## Losing Database Administrator #2

I came into work at 9am one day and noticed that DBA#2 wasn't at his desk, and David's blinds were down on his office, and I could hear raised voices. DBA#2 then stormed out, never to return.

I got filled in as to what had happened afterwards. DBA#2 was very outspoken about David not respecting his Work-Life Balance, which brought him into conflict quite often.

The tale was that overnight DBA#2 was the engineer on-call and had missed an alert, David apparently jumped on DBA#2 as soon as he walked through the door (before he'd even had chance to sit down and get a coffee..) that morning and the argument had been going since then and had boiled over.

DBA#2 walked out and never came back.

## New Technical Challenges (?!)

Remember that in our [last part](/blog/2024/04/story-time-job-04-p1-going-back-3rd-line-support/), **Hurt Feelings..** section, Jay had been poached by **Managed Security Provider** and David had immediately decided to ditch them and find a new provider.

David followed through on this, and had chosen a **Big Telco** to rip out the *Check Point* firewalls and move us to *Whatever They Were Offering*. This turned out to be *Cisco ASA* Firewalls, and we (the Infrastructure Team) would have to support this migration (with the added kicker that we used to have *Admin* rights on the Check Points, we'd only have *Read-Only* access on the Ciscos :frowning_face:)

It was my job to help rip out the *Check Points* and **Managed Security Provider**. This made little sense to me, and I was a bit bummed out as I had wanted to focus more on the security side of things. David tried to spin this as a *positive* that I got to work on this project. I pointed out that this was a *negative* as I was only learning enough to jetison them and become a glorified *Firewall Helpdesk* where all I would do would be raise support requests to **Big Telco** and wait.

## Hurt Feelings (again)

I had kept in touch with Jay after he'd jumped ship, and one day he reached out to me asking me if I fancied a job at **Managed Security Provider**..

Uh oh, I did really want to get into Security, Networking, Unix/Linux, and this seemed like a great opportunity. I knew I didn't have very much *Check Point* experience to speak of, but I knew I was clueful around Security in general.

I wanted to know a bit more about the business and the job, and Jay asked me to come in to their office (in North Leeds) and have a chat.

They couldn't beat my salary at my current job, but we agreed a deal where they would *just* beat it (by £500!) if I got a *Check Point* certification (which they would pay for.)

So... I quit and was the second one to jump ship from David's team to **Managed Security Provider**. Jay wouldn't have poached me if David hadn't dumped them, so off I went, quitting this company for the second (and last) time! :wave:
