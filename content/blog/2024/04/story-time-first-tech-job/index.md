## Hello, Helpdesk. MacKenzie speaking (2003/04)

When I graduated in the Summer of 2003 I was hoping for a bit of time off, lazing around on the dole. That.... didn't happen. I got my first tech job after about 5 or 6 weeks... and even more annoyingly it wasn't for a cool tech company, on a fast track.. I mean I got the top result at University..

It was for a local company building supplies company who needed someone to answer the phones on a Helpdesk. This was the Microsoft Era, so Windows, Windows and more Windows.

There were three people on the Helpdesk, and I was shadowing a long-standing temp. We had headsets and they paired my headset to his headset so we could both hear/speak to the same call. I was a very awkward and unsociable geek, and this was my idea of hell. Talking to people on the phone. Oh my god. No! I listened to users calling up this internal company helpdesk with problems, requests etc, and really was dreading the end of my onboarding week(s)... but I eventually faced my fears and got on the phones solo.

One small thing that was good about this particular Helpdesk is that there were not very much micro-management of your time or workload, you could be a drone "Let me log and ticket and get you off the phone" worker, or could try and syncronously fix things live. I was more the latter kind, and built up a reputation among some of the frequent callers as being a good person to speak to.

### Coffee + Laptop = :joy:

There were occassional moments of unintentional humour, one caller had spilt a coffee over their work laptop.. I put them on hold.. laughed out loud, shared the joke with my colleagues, laughed some more, then asked "But seriously, what am I supposed to tell them?" "Uh... ask if there was sugar in the coffee?" "**off hold** _Serious voice_ OK, this is important... but was there sugar in the coffee? .... (a timid "yes")... "OK please hold"... more laughter. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### zOMG $MOST_IMPORTANT_APPLICATION IS DOWN!!11

I remember in my first week there was a massive outage of their company's *$MOST_IMPORTANT_APPLICATION*, and the phone lines lit up with a flood of calls. My temp coworker looked happy (and I was confused about why he looked happy), but I soon found out that when "everything is down" the incoming calls become repeating the calming mantra of :

`It's Down For Everyone Not Just You`:tm:

Which means the call is quick, you don't have to log a ticket, the caller can relax, they don't have to fight the hypothetical unhelpful Helpdesk person, they don't have to wonder if *they* did something wrong, or if we're going to ask them a zillion random questions.

### The False Economy of Inkjet Printers :cursing_face:

Our users didn't have `Administrator` rights, and they had to call us if they wanted to install a non-network printer (for network printers, they would automatically get their local printers added via Group Policy.)

We would then have to VNC (think Remote Desktop) to their machine, `Run-As Administrator` on the `setup.exe` for that printer model, click through the Next, Next, Next guide, asking them to plug-in and turn on the printer when prompted. Print a test page.. It was slow, but usually not that stressful.

I was told that the way the finance/budgets worked at the company was that there was no real pot for central IT spending, it was every person for themselves, and it was easy to get your manager to approve a ¬£50 Lexmark, or Epson inkjet printer. So they multiplied like rabbits. (and so did the printer cartridge expenses :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:)

We developed a particular hatred for one cursed printer in Lexmark's budget inkjet range, they called it the `Z55`. It had a habit of dying and refusing to print after a handful of pages. Our Helpdesk policy was to help the customer file a return with Lexmark, which meant a three-way game of Telephone with Lexmark Support, the End User and The Helpdesk. Lexmark's script, which they insisted we stuck to, even after we all realised how broken and systematic the problem was, called for something ridiculously long winded like:

1. Turn off the printer.
2. Uninstall the drivers.
3. Reboot the PC.
4. Install the drivers.
5. Turn on the printer.
6. Print a test page.

And if that didn't work, loop through it twice... In the end we cried enough to our manager that they allowed us to implement a policy that at the first mention of `Z55` we would refuse support and tell them to throw it in the bin and buy an EPSON.

That didn't stop people trying though, for my entire time you would get an innocent person who probably found a "spare" printer lying around, or thrown in a dark storeroom corner and asking us to install it for them. :ng_woman:

## My First On-Call

This Helpdesk was Mon-Fri 9-5pm in the office with no on-call, but during my time there they added a very modest paid on-call rota. The rota just meant covering the Helpdesk number outside of the normal hours for a few hours before / after, so 6am-8am and then 6pm-8pm. It was the best kind of paid on-call, it was [Money For Old Rope](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/money_for_old_rope). I can only remember getting called once, and it was a 5 minute routine "I can't log in as my old session is still active" job, thankfully I even had my work laptop handy and could do the ticket and help out a stressed user.

## Outgrowing The Helpdesk

I set the pattern that would follow me for the majority of my career in that first Helpdesk job. The pattern was that I would go through these phases:

1. Join, know nothing, learn enough to be dangerous (ie, useful).
2. Find and fix the things that needed fixing (having fun).
3. Start to hit pushback on things that couldn't be fixed for (delete as appropriate) Political / Bureaucractic / Turf-war / Financial reasons.
4. Become aware of the skeletons of the organisation, the unfair, the unjust, unworkable rules and power struggles.
5. Become disillusioned about the above, hitting the point where I stop learning new transferable skills and start only learning institution-specific skills.

In this role I quickly realised that I wanted to get a promotion out of 1st line support (ie **off the phones**) and into 2nd or 3rd line support. This I was told was not possible, as it was a case of **dead persons shoes**.

So I ended up quitting and moving on after about a year. My next move was Not The Best:tm:, but that's a story for another day.
