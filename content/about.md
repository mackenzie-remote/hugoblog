## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is MacKenzie and I've made the unfortunate decision to start a blog.

I'm a gray-haired 40-something-year-old white male tech worker, originally from the UK and now living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

I last had a blog (or at least.. a website) in the late 90s when I was addicted to Quake.

The driving force behind starting this blog was a reflection that a thing I really miss about the Before Times (when I was forced to commute to an office Monday to Friday) was story telling. I thought I would try using this blog to write up some of my stories, they're probably not going to come across quite as well as being told verbally (and I would hope, the story is relevant in some way), but let's see.
